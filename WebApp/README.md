## Description
The purpose of Masterpiece Market is to be a self-supplied digital marketplace for users to buy and sell personal art. We plan for users to interact with other users to ensure all sales are discussed. Masterpiece Market provides artists with a platform to showcase their work and connect directly with buyers. Our platform prioritizes user interaction, ensuring that all transactions involve direct communication between buyers and sellers for a more personalized experience. The marketplace will feature a simple interface where users can browse art listings and purchase those that they like. By creating a community-driven marketplace, we aim to create a seamless experience for both artists and art lovers.
